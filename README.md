# Use Reflection to personal IOC container
use reflection to find constructor of class and get list of parameters in class constructor

Reflection in C# is used to retrieve metadata on types at runtime. In other words, you can use reflection to inspect metadata of the types in your program dynamically -- you can retrieve information on the loaded assemblies and the types defined in them. Reflection in C# is similar to RTTI (Runtime Type Information) of C++.

To work with reflection in .Net, you should include the System.Reflection namespace in your program. In using reflection, you get objects of the type "Type" that can be used to represent assemblies, types, or modules. You can use reflection to create an instance of a type dynamically and even invoke methods of the type.
